# Install notes for the Retroid Pocket Mini handheld console

General guidelines : https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/03/13/android-emulation-starter-guide/

## Syncthing

I have an "Emulation" folder on my hardrive, with various ressources. I' using Syncthing extensively for convenience : if I want to add/edit sometging, I just do it on my PC and changes get synced automatically.

My main shares are the following :
- BIOS - Platforms (files sorted by patform, as an archive) > `storage/7AE4-BF10/BIOS/Plateformes` (where 7AE4-BF10 is my external SD card number) as a large reference archive
- BIOS - RetroArch (same but filtered and flattened) > `storage/7AE4-BF10/BIOS/RetroArch` as an unaltered archive (not my RA system folder because a lot of stuff is added to the system folder by RA)
- ROMs sorted according the ES-DE folder naming scheme > `/storage/7AE4-BF10/ROMs` with exexclusions (see below)
- A shared folder where I store APKs and drivers such as Turnip's to have them on my device for the - initial install > `storage/7AE4-BF10/Synchronisation/Shared`
- Dolphin shaders >  `storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu/files/Shaders
storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu/files/Shaders`
- RetroArch config folder > `/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/config`
- RetroArch overlays for Vectrex > `/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/overlays/vecx`
- RetroArch Guest slang shaders >  `/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/shaders/shaders_slang/crt/shaders/guest` 
- RetroArch Retro slang Crisis shaders `/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/shaders/shaders_slang/retro crisis
/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/shaders/shaders_slang/retro crisis`
- RetroArch Sonkun shaders `/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/shaders/shaders_slang/sonkun/storage/emulated/0/RetroArch/shaders/shaders_slang/sonkun`
- Screenshots > `storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshots`

Syncthing offers the possibility to filter what gets synced. It's particularily usefull for ROMs. I don't sync 16:9 systems to my RPM so I've setup the followinf exclusions for the ROMs sync :
```psp
psvita
xbox
wiiu
switch
*.3ds
*.xls
.nomedia
m3u-generator.py
gamelist.xml
systems.txt
.media
.images
```

## Emulators install

Use Obtainium with the https://github.com/RJNY/Obtainium-Emulation-Pack to install :
- Azahar
- Dolphin
- RetroArch (nightly)
- MelonDS

For PS2 emulation :
1. Build/patch https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-patch
2. Build/patch https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-classic
Install Classic and keep the other just in case 

Other systems are emulated with RetroArch so as to get a better shader support.

## Frontend

Either Daijish≈ç with Obtainium, or ES-DE (link in mailbox). I choose ES-DE :
- Use https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/esde_android_apps so as to import Android apps apps, games and emulators in ES-DE. To install, add https://github.com/schattenphoenix/es_applauncher/releases in Obtainium
- Set as the default launcher to improve the "handheld console" experience and forget about Android. Before
